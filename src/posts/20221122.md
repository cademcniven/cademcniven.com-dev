title: Refactoring Japanese Anki Cards

{% raw %}

When you use Anki for a meaningful amount of time, you eventually realize that your early cards suck. Rather than suffering through poorly made cards (or worse, deleting them), it's worth spending a few seconds to update them.

The idea of updating (refactoring) old, poorly made, flashcards is nothing new. There are already plenty of articles on the subject, such as

* [Anki Tips: The Biweekly Design Review](https://medium.com/euthyphroria/anki-tips-the-biweekly-design-review-d9bc430c61af)
* [Refactoring Anki Language Cards](https://www.ojisanseiuchi.com/2021/03/20/refactoring-anki-language-cards/)
* [How to Improve your Flashcard Knowledge Base](https://www.marknagelberg.com/how-to-improve-your-flashcard-knowledge-base/)

They're good articles, and I suggest you give them a read if you want to learn more about the subject. As someone who has been using anki for a while now...

...this is a subject that has really stuck out to me as important. I've gone through [multiple](/projects/notetype) different [note types](/projects/notetype2), and changed my mining process many times as well. There are a lot of questional decisions I made when making earlier flashcards, and it's taken me a long time to slowly figure out all the things that do and don't work.

These mistakes have given me extra insight to which parts of your flashcards deserve extra attention, and which parts you can just automate.

## Why Should I Refactor Cards in the First Place?

In my experience with learning Japanese, there are 2 main issues with having poorly made Anki cards:

1. Poorly made cards may give you unintended context or information that helps you recall the meaning/reading of a word. This can cause some cards to get huge intervals (1y+), but when you see the word in immersion you still have to look it up -- you just don't know the word.
2. Poorly made cards can also have the opposite effect -- they make remembering the word even more difficult.

Both of these scenarios mean you're going to have to spend much more time than usual to learn the word.

While it may seem tedious and not worth the time to edit old cards, it will actually save you time in the long run because learning words will be much easier.

## What Should I Refactor?

It's hard to give a broad rule on what things need to be refactored, so instead I'll show you concrete examples from my own experience.

### Parenthesis

![parenethesis in an anki card](/images/20221122/parenthesis.png)

Now this isn't *always* a problem, so for many cards you could just ignore this. However, I have found that, particularly on cards with very short sentences, having the speakers name in parenthesis in your sentence can give away the card.

It can give the sentence a certain "shape" that your eye easily recognizes -- and you can associate that shape with the meaning/reading of the word. This is espectially prevalent if you mine a "sentence" that's only 1 word wrong, but has parenthesis next to it.

Simply removing that part from the field of your card is a good enough fix.

You can actually take this one step further by auto-removing it from all future cards you make too. If you use yomichan you can update your anki card template handlebars to have the following:

```handlebars
{{#*inline "cloze-prefix"}}
    {{~#if definition.cloze}}
        {{#regexReplace "（.*）| \(.*\)|　*|\s+" "" "g"}}     {{definition.cloze.prefix}}{{/regexReplace}}
    {{/if~}}
{{/inline}}

{{#*inline "cloze-body"}}
{{~#if definition.cloze}}
        {{#regexReplace "（.*）| \(.*\)|　*|\s+" "" "g"}}     {{definition.cloze.body}}{{/regexReplace}}
    {{/if~}}
{{/inline}}

{{#*inline "cloze-suffix"}}
    {{~#if definition.cloze}}
        {{#regexReplace "（.*）| \(.*\)|　*|\s+" "" "g"}}     {{definition.cloze.suffix}}{{/regexReplace}}
    {{/if~}}
{{/inline}}
```

```close-prefix```, ```cloze-body```, and ```cloze-suffix``` are in your template by default, but the regex replace part is what is changed here. This regex will do 2 things:

1. Remove parenthesis from the sentence, as well as any text inside of them
2. Remove any spaces from the sentence

This is assuming your sentence field on your Anki card format (in Yomichan) is something like ```{cloze-prefix}<span class="highlight">{cloze-body}</span>{cloze-suffix}```.

For what it's worth, I consider excess spaces in your sentence to be the same issue as having unnecessary parenthesis -- it gives the sentence a shape that gives unintended context and can give away the answer to the card.

### Multiple Spellings

![multiple spellings of a word](/images/20221122/spelling.png)

Sometimes you may come across a word in kana, but you want to learn the kanji version. If you mine like that, you might end up with cards that look like the above image.

I think it's pretty obvious to see where the issue is here. If the kana version of the word is highlighted right below the kanji version of the word, it's **much** less likely that you'll remember the reading of the word. To fix that you just need to change the word in the sentence to also be the kanji version.
