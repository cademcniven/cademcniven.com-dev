[Use it here](/subtitleCharacterCounter.html)

## Features

* Works with multiple files at once
* Works with pretty much any format
* Works on desktop and mobile
* Doesn't count alphanumeric characters or punctuation

## How To Use

Go to the [Subtitle Character Counter page](/subtitleCharacterCounter.html) and drag one or more subtitle files onto the page.

## Use Case

This is meant to count the number of **Japanese** characters in subtitle files so language learners can more easily and accurately log how many characters they've consumed. The benefit over mpv + a texthooker is that you can just log everything at once after you've finished a show, rather than adding up the characters from each episode. Additionally, this allows people who watch without a texthooker ([for example, animebook](/posts/20210703)) to log exact character counts.

## Offline Use

This was designed as a one-page app, so you can simply right click the page and click "Save Page As".
