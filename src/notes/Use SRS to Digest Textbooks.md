title: Use SRS to Digest Textbooks
---

This is most useful for subject like math/science, where future chapters build upon earlier ones. In cases like these, it's important to get the fundamentals really ingrained so that you can fully understand the contents of future chapters.

Moving on to future chapters without understanding earlier chapters is a **very bad decision** because it makes identifying important information much much harder. It also makes it much more difficult to have any valuable insights, because it's likely you just won't understand what's going on.

One strategy is to pause reading for up to a week after making flash cards to give yourself time to internalize the concepts (doing daily reviews of course). In the mean time it's fair game to read other books, and even employ the same strategy. If you felt like it, you could be on a 7 book cycle that you read once a week each and review [[SRS]] for on the other days.
