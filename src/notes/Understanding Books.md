title: Understanding Books

Reading is passive learning, but needs to be transformed into active learning to be truly effective

[[Books Don't Work]]. Therefore, one of two things (or both) need to happen:

1. Create a new medium that *does* work
    Where "work" means "effectively teaches something"
2. Create a reading strategy that makes books work

> how might we design mediums in which “reading” is the same as “understanding”? ...I believe that the answers to questions like these can transform the pace of human knowledge, echoing the transformation which books themselves sparked so long ago. [^1]
