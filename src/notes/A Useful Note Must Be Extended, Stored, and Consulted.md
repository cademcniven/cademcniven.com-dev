title: A Useful Note Must Be Extended, Stored, and Consulted

> A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted. [^1]

The digital garden (and some other modern tools) largely enables this. Markdown allows me to write in (almost) plain English and get well formatted documents out of it. My current workflow also allows me to create/edit/delete notes and have those changes immediately reflected on my personal site. The philosophy and structure of Zettelkasten's also make things more convenient. Notes don't have to be long -- perhaps only a couple sentences -- which means it doesn't feel like a large commitment to begin writing something. Short writings (plus backlinks) also make reviewing much easier and promote spontaneity.
